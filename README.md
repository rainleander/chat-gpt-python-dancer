# ChatGPT Python Dancer Experiment
I gave the OpenAI [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) the following prompt: "write a python program that draws a dancer"

It responded with the following caveat, "As an AI language model, I don't have a visual interface to draw a dancer. However, I can give you an example code to draw a dancer using Python's turtle graphics module. Here's an example code:" and the code in main.py.

Then I asked it to "please write a blog post about this program" which is available via [TheRain.Dev](https://therain.dev/).

Finally, I prompted, "assuming the code is available via https://github.com/rainleander/chat-gpt-python-dancer/, please write instructions for executing this code locally"

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
git clone https://github.com/rainleander/chat-gpt-python-dancer.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.
3. Navigate to the project directory by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
cd chat-gpt-python-dancer
```
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Finally, run the program by running the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```

That's it! You should now be able to execute the code locally on your machine. If you have any issues, feel free to consult the README file or contact the repository owner for assistance.
